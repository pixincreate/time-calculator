# Time-Calculator
Time Calculator, as the name states, calculates time(except seconds).  
## Working:
- User is asked to enter the limit, i.e., max number of entries.
- Entries are taken one by one in `hh1:mm1-hh2:mm2` format.
- The Difference is calculated and then the Differences are Added together to give the output.
### Story behind Time-Calculator's existance
I live in a City, where the Government doesn't care about citizen but money and power. In a day(24 hours), I live without any sort of power for atleast 10 hours, which kinda suck! and I hate it. I complained this to them a ton of times but in vain without any proofs of timings. So, I decided to make a note of timings of power cuts. Ok, I noted them all, **who the hell gonna calculate all these?** searched the internet and found some websites that can only take `2` inputs which in our case is `hh1` and `hh2`. But I'd much more inputs! I couldn't find a reliable website and within seconds my mind said that *"I'm a coder and haven't coded for about, more than 10 months straight! why not start doing it now!?"* and voila! I started this easy project in the morning in `C++` language which is my favourite of all. Spent some time in getting used to it.   
Started this in the morning at around `12:06PM` and ended at around `6:27PM` in the evening. Had a lot of fun writing the code **hitting** my head around, **searching** for doubts  and errors on **DuckDuckGo** and felt like an experienced newbie, *lol*!
